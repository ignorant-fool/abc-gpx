# abc-gpx
A pseudo-inversion process for profile gravity data based on approximate bayesian computation methods.


## Workflow
1. Use ABC methods to perform a Bayesian pseudo-inversion of profile gravity data.
2. We will set priors on all body parameters
    - depth to top of body
    - depth extent of the body
    - the density contrast of the body
    - the dip of the body
    - thickness of the body
    - +- the X/Y location of the body (tbd.)
3. ABC workflow is roughly: 
    - generate samples for each parameter, fwd model the response
    - calculate the misfit from some reference body we're aiming for
    - throwaway every fwd model that isn't within +- eps of the reference body
    - do inference and uncertainty quantification on the reminaing fwd models and their parameters


## Notes:
- This project utilizes Poetry for keeping package version control.
- This project utilizes SimPEG for all it's geophysical modelling.

## To-do:
- Get a helper function written for generating dipping body coordinates
- Tidy up grav_synthetic.py in general (s.t. it's not an exact copy of the SimPEG example)
    - Fix s.t. the warnings no longer pop up as well (in the tensor mesh I believe?)
- Fix the data outputs to go in the correct directory
- Find open public ground gravity data to attempt a case-study on (GSQ/GSWA/etc)
